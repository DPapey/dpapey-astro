## 🚀 First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post. My blog will primarily discuss Web Development
and Photography.

## 🖥️ Computing

As some information about myself, I am a recent MSc Computing graduate achieving
the grade of Distinction. With my home in the North East of England, I am very
proud of my achievment. Among this, my course has allowed me to continue pursuing
my CCNA certifications, with currently working on Part 2: Ethernet, Switching
and Wireless LANs.
