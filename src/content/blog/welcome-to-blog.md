# Welcome to the DPapey Networking / Data Blog

## Formal Introduction

Hello, I’m **DPapey** — and welcome to my technical blog!

With a background in IT and a growing specialisation in both **Data** and **Networking**, this blog is a space for me to share practical solutions, walkthroughs, and thoughts from real-world experience.

---

## What I Do

- 📡 Currently studying the **CCNA** curriculum through the **Cisco Networking Academy**, building a solid foundation in routing, switching, and network security.
- 🗃️ Working frequently with **SQL**, designing **normalised relational schemas** and writing **efficient queries** for scalable, real-world applications.
- 🐧 Building **system-independent** environments using **Docker**, especially for hosting local MariaDB and PostgreSQL databases.
- 🔐 Interested in **data integrity**, **network segmentation**, and securing both infrastructure and database access.

---

## Why This Blog?

This blog serves two goals:

1. **Documentation for myself** – sharing how I set up local environments, handle network configs, or build clean data models.
2. **Education for others** – whether you’re learning SQL, Docker, or trying to spin up a test lab for CCNA concepts, you’ll hopefully find something useful here.

---

## Coming Up Next

I’ll be publishing walkthroughs and examples, including:

- Setting up **MariaDB & phpMyAdmin** in Docker
- Managing SQL projects in a modular, maintainable way
- Creating a lightweight **lab environment** for CCNA routing simulations
- Using **Neovim** for modern web development (including Astro + SQL)
